                i get in my head a lot and sometimes too much, im consantly
                worried about if im making you happy, and if im good for you, to
                the point that i feel like im annoying you by consantly asking
                if youre happy or satisfied.<br />
                Sorry about that, I'll try to not ask you as much, but i'll
                never stop thinking about you and being concerned. I want to
                make you happy.
